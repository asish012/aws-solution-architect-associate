# Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) #
- On Demand:
    - Pay fixed rate by the hour (or second) with no commitment.
    - Low cost and flexible.
    - Short term, spiky or unpredictable workloads.
    - Applications developed or tested on EC2 for the first time.
- Reserved:
    - 1 or 3 year terms. You get discount on hourly charge.
    - Applications with steady or predictable usage.
    - Standard Reserved Instances (RI): Can save up to 75% off on-demand.
    - Convertible (changeable) Reserved Instances: Can save up to 54%.
- Scheduled Reserved Instances:
    - If you need EC2 within the time window you reserve, a predictable recurring schedule, e.g. every day/week/month at certain time.
- Spot:
    - Bid a price. You can use it if you have a flexible start and end time.
    - e.g. 4am Sunday morning, instead of workday 9-5.
    - You won't be charged if AWS terminates the instance (perhaps the price went up). But you have to pay if you terminate the instance.
- Dedicated Host:
    - Physical EC2 servers.
    - If you are not allowed to go to cloud/multi-tenancy environment.
    - Can save up-to 70%.


# EC2 Instance Type #
- F1: Field programmable gate array:    Big data, genomic research
- I3: High Speed Storage:               NoSQL, Data warehousing
- G3: Graphics Intensive:
- H1: High disk throughput:             MapReduce workload, Distributed file systems (HDFS/MapR-FS)
- T2: Cheap general purpose:            Web servers/Small DBs
- D2:
- R4: Memory optimized:
- M5: General purpose:                  Application server
- C5: Compute optimized
- P3: General purpose GPU:              Machine learning, Bit coin mining
- X1: Memory optimized:                 ApacheSpark


# Elastic Block Storage (EBS) (Virtual Disk) #
EBS allows you to create storage volume and attach them to EC2 instances. Once attached, you then can create a file system on top of these volumes and run a database or use them in any other ways you would use a block device.
EBS volumes are placed in a specific Availability Zone where the are automatically replicated.


# EBS Volume Types #
- General purpose **SSD** (GP2)
    - <= 10,000 IOPS
- Provisionid IOPS **SSD** (IO1)
    - 10,000 to 20,000 IOPS

- Throughput Optimized HDD (ST1)
    - Big data
    - Data warehouse
    - Log processing
    - Can't be boot volume. It can only be used as additional drives.
- Cold HDD (SC1)
    - Lowest const storage, appropriate for infrequent accessed workloads
    - Can't be boot volume. It can only be used as additional drives.
- Magnetic (Standard)
    - Lowest cost per giga of all EBS volume types that bootable.
