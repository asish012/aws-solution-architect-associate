### VPC 101 ###
- 1 Subnet is 1 Availability Zone
- AWS Subnet Classes:
    - 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix)               Subnet mask: 255.0.0.0
    - 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix)        Subnet mask: 255.240.0.0
    - 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)     Subnet mask: 255.255.0.0

- Once you create a new VPC, you get these created automatically:
    - XX

**What you can do with a VPC**
- You can launch an instance into a subnet of your choosing.
- Assign custom IP address ranges in each subnet.
- Configure route tables between subnets.
- Create internet gateway and attach it to your VPC.
    - You can have only one internet gateway per VPC
- Create a Security group
    - Security Group can span multiple AZ
- Subnet network access control list (ACLS)

**Default VPC vs Custom VPC**
- All subnets in default VPC have a route out to the internet.
- All EC2 instances inside default VPC gets private and public IP address. EC2 inside custom VPC gets private IP address by default.

**VPC Peering**
- You can peer VPCs via direct network route using private IP addresses.
    - VPCs from different subnets can connect to each other as well using private ip addresses.
    - VPCs from different accounts also can connect using private ip addresses.
- VPC peering connections has to be direct.
    - A -> B -> C doesn't give access from A -> C
    - you have to peer A -> C separately.

**Tips**
- 1 Subnet = 1 AZ
- Security Groups are Stateful:
    - If you open port 80 of your security group, you'll be able to send and receive through.
- Network Access Control Lists are Stateless
    - If you open port 80 for inbound only, you won't be able to send traffic through port 80. you have to add outbound rule explicitly.
