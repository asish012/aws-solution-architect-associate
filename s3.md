# AWS Storage Gateway Types #

**file gateway**
- Provides low-latency NFS and SMB access to Amazon S3 objects from on-premises applications. At the same time customers can access that data from any Amazon S3 API-enabled application.
- Configuring AWS Storage Gateway as a file gateway enables hybrid cloud storage architectures in use cases such as archiving, on-demand bursting of workloads, and backup to the AWS Cloud.

+ Use case: File Gateway:
    + Cloud Tiering: Where on-premises storage resources are reaching capacity, migrating colder data to the file gateway can extend the life span of existing on-premises storage.
    + Hybrid Cloud Backup

**Tape Gateway**

**Volume Gateway**


# Logging #

**Cloud Trail Logging**
- Cloud Trail collects information such as:
    - What request was made to Amazon S3
    - The source IP address from which the request was made
    - Who made the request
    - When it was made, and so on. 
    - This information helps you to track changes made to your AWS resources and to troubleshoot operational issues.
    + You can also get object level S3 action logs in Cloud Trail.
    * VPC Flow Log doesn't track S3 traffic, because S3 is not part of VPC, S3 is a managed service.

**VPC Flow Log**

**Server Access Logging**
- Server access logging provides detailed records for the requests that are made to a S3 bucket.
- It can also help you learn about your customer base and understand your Amazon S3 bill.
